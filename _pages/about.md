Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for the Study of the Societies](https://www.mpifg.de/2733/en). I received my PhD at the [DYNAMICS graduate school](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/), a PhD program jointly run by Humboldt University Berlin and the Hertie School. Prior to my PhD, I worked in consulting and for the EU institutions. I completed my MPhil in European Politics at the University of Oxford and my BA in History at King's College London.  

My interests lie in the political economy of European countries from a comparative angle. In my resarch, I examine how politics intersect with wage formation, income stagnation and labour market institutions.  Methodologically, I specialize in time series and panel data analysis. I have also taken a great interest in quantitative text analysis and in leveraging natural language processing to answer research questions in comparative political economy.  

On this website you can find my [publications](https://joshcova.github.io/publications/), my [CV](https://joshcova.github.io/files/CV_COVA_Aug_2023.pdf) and my [teaching experience](https://joshcova.github.io/teaching/). Feel free to reach out if you are interested to connect, talk about projects and common interests!
