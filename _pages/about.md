Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies](https://www.mpifg.de/2733/en). I completed my PhD at the [DYNAMICS graduate school](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/), a PhD program jointly run by Humboldt University Berlin and the Hertie School. Prior to my PhD, I worked in consulting and for the EU institutions. I obtained an MPhil in European Politics from the University of Oxford and a BA in History from King's College London.  

My interests lie in the political economy of European countries, which I examine from a comparative perspective. In my work, I study how politics interact with wage formation, income stagnation and labour market institutions.  Methodologically, I specialize in time series and panel data analysis. I have also taken an interest in quantitative text analysis and in leveraging natural language processing techniques to answer questions in comparative political economy.  

On this website you can find my [publications](https://joshcova.github.io/publications/), my [CV](https://joshcova.github.io/files/CV_COVA_Nov2024.pdf) and my [teaching experience](https://joshcova.github.io/teaching/). Feel free to reach out at <cj@mpifg.de> if you are interested to connect, talk about projects and common interests!
