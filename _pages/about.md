Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of the Societies based in Cologne. I received my PhD at the [DYNAMICS graduate school](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/), a PhD program jointly run by [Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) and the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/).  

Research interest
======

I am broadly interested in examing the political economy of European countries from a comparative angle. I examine. Methodologically, I specialize in time series and panel data analysis. I have also taken a great interest in quantitative text analysis and the uses of natural language processing to answer questions in comparative political eocnomy.  

On this webisite you can find my [publications](https://joshcova.github.io/publications/), my [CV](https://joshcova.github.io/files/CV_COVA_Aug_2023.pdf) and my [teaching experience](https://joshcova.github.io/teaching/). Feel free to reach out if you are interested!
