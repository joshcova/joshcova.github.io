Hello! I am a senior researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies](https://www.mpifg.de/2733/en). I completed my PhD at the [DYNAMICS graduate school](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/), a PhD program jointly run by Humboldt University Berlin and the Hertie School. Prior to my PhD, I worked in consulting and for the EU institutions. I obtained an MPhil in European Politics from the University of Oxford and a BA from King's College London.  

My interests lie in the political economy of European democracies, which I examine from a comparative perspective. In my work, I study how political parties interact with trade unions and labour market institutions to shape policy outcomes, particularly in the areas of wage formation and inflation.  I am also interested in European economic governance, with a specific focus in understanding how the EU's economic policies and preferences affect member states' national labour markets.

Methodologically, I specialize in text-as-data methods and in leveraging natural language processing techniques to answer questions in comparative political economy. I have also taken an interest in time series and panel data analysis. 

My research has been published in academic journals including *European Union Politics*, the *Journal of European Social Policy* and the *European Journal of Industrial Relations*.

Amongst other things, on this website you can find my [publications](https://joshcova.github.io/publications/), my [CV](https://joshcova.github.io/files/CV_COVA_Jan_2025.pdf) and my [teaching experience](https://joshcova.github.io/teaching/).
